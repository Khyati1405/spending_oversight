# Personal Expense Tracking App

The goal of this project is that it lets you (as a user) track and categorize your monthly expenses and help you budget.

The app will let users type their expense category and amount. It'll then save (append) that expense entry to a file. And finally, read the file to summarise the expense totals for that month.

It'll also tell the user how much they can spend for the rest of the month to stay in budget (which is a custom value decided by your app, e.g. `$2000`.

## ðŸŽ¯ App Requirements

1. Ask the user to add an expense (name, category, amount)
2. Save expense entries to a `.csv` file.
3. Read the file to summarise the expense totals for that month
4. Show the user how much they can spend for the rest of the month (to stay in budget)
